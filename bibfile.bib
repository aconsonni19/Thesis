abstract="Blockchain-based applications, such as web3.0, play an increasingly important role in the future internet, but security issues pose a significant threat to their development. Static analysis techniques can help mitigate software vulnerabilities, including those in smart contracts, by analyzing the source code of blockchain-based applications without executing it to identify potential security issues. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between blockchain-based applications and static analysis-based code vulnerability detection techniques with a focus on smart contracts. First, it introduces the background of both blockchain and static analysis techniques. Then, it discusses the theoretical foundation of static analysis and the different analysis methods based on intermediate representations of code. It also offers a review of the key techniques and achievements in the fields of traditional static analysis and learning-based analysis, highlighting the particular challenges of applying them to smart contracts. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges in code vulnerability detection based on static analysis and provides potential future research directions. Our literature review aims to provide software developers and researchers with a comprehensive perspective on the relationship among blockchain-based applications, smart contracts and static analysis-based code vulnerability detection techniques, which can help enhance the security of these applications and promote their practical application in the future internet.",

abstract = {CodeSurfer/x86 is a prototype system for analyzing x86 executables. It uses a static-analysis algorithm called value-set analysis (VSA) to recover intermediate representations that are similar to those that a compiler creates for a program written in a high-level language. A major challenge in building an analysis tool for executables is in providing useful information about operations involving memory. This is difficult when symbol-table and debugging information is absent or untrusted. CodeSurfer/x86 overcomes these challenges to provide an analyst with a powerful and flexible platform for investigating the properties and behaviors of potentially malicious code (such as COTS components, plugins, mobile code, worms, Trojans, and virus-infected code) using (i) CodeSurfer/x86's GUI, (ii) CodeSurfer/x86's scripting language, which provides access to all of the intermediate representations that CodeSurfer/x86 builds for the executable, and (iii) GrammaTech's Path Inspector, which is a tool that uses a sophisticated pattern-matching engine to answer questions about the flow of execution in a program.},

abstract = {We address the problem of finding similar procedures in stripped binaries. We present a new statistical approach for measuring the similarity between two procedures. Our notion of similarity allows us to find similar code even when it has been compiled using different compilers, or has been modified. The main idea is to use similarity by composition: decompose the code into smaller comparable fragments, define semantic similarity between fragments, and use statistical reasoning to lift fragment similarity into similarity between procedures. We have implemented our approach in a tool called Esh, and applied it to find various prominent vulnerabilities across compilers and versions, including Heartbleed, Shellshock and Venom. We show that Esh produces high accuracy results, with few to no false positives -- a crucial factor in the scenario of vulnerability search in stripped binaries.},

abstract = {Cyberattacks typically exploit software vulnerabilities to compromise computers and smart devices. To address vulnerabilities, many approaches have been developed to detect vulnerabilities using deep learning. However, most learning-based approaches detect vulnerabilities in source code instead of binary code. In this paper, we present our approach on detecting vulnerabilities in binary code. Our approach uses binary code compiled from the SARD dataset to build deep learning models to detect vulnerabilities. It extracts features on the syntax information of the assembly instructions in binary code, and trains two deep learning models on the features for vulnerability detection. From our evaluation, we find that the BLSTM model has the best performance, which achieves an accuracy rate of 81\% in detecting vulnerabilities. Particularly the F1-score, recall, and specificity of the BLSTM model are 75\%, 95\% and 75\% respectively. This indicates that the model is balanced in detecting both vulnerable code and non-vulnerable code.},
